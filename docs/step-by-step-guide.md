# **Step-by-Step Guide: How the Document-to-Podcast Blueprint Works**

Transforming static documents into engaging podcast episodes involves an integration of pre-processing, LLM-powered transcript generation, and text-to-speech generation. Here's how it all works under the hood:

---

## **Overview**
This system has three core stages:


üìÑ **1. Document Pre-Processing**
   Prepare the input document by extracting and cleaning the text.

üìú **2. Podcast Script Generation**
   Use an LLM to transform the cleaned text into a conversational podcast script.

üéôÔ∏è **3. Audio Podcast Generation**
   Convert the script into an engaging audio podcast with distinct speaker voices.

We'll also look at how `app.py` brings all these steps together to build an end-to-end demo application.

First, let‚Äôs dive into each step to understand how this works in practice.

## **Step 1: Document Pre-Processing**

The process begins with preparing the input document for AI processing. The system handles various document types while ensuring the extracted content is clean and structured.

Cleaner input data ensures that the model works with reliable and consistent information, reducing the likelihood of confusing with unexpected tokens and therefore helping it to generate better outputs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Components in this Doc Pre-Processing**
 **1 - File Loading**

   - Uses functions defined in [`data_loaders.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.preprocessing.data_loaders)

   - Supports `.html`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.docx` formats.

   - Extracts readable text from uploaded files using specialized loaders.

 **2 - Text Cleaning**

   - Uses functions defined in [`data_cleaners.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.preprocessing.data_cleaners)

   - Removes unwanted elements like URLs, email addresses, and special characters using Python's `re` library, which leverages **Regular Expressions** (regex) to identify and manipulate specific patterns in text.

   - Ensures the document is clean and ready for the next step.

## **Step 2: Podcast Script Generation**

In this step, the pre-processed text is transformed into a conversational podcast transcript. Using a Language Model, the system generates a dialogue that‚Äôs both informative and engaging.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Components in Script Generation**

 **1 - Model Loading**

   - The [`model_loader.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.inference.model_loaders) script is responsible for loading GGUF-type models using the `llama_cpp` library.

   - The function `load_llama_cpp_model` takes a model ID in the format `{org}/{repo}/{filename}` and loads the specified model.

   - This approach of using the `llama_cpp` library supports efficient CPU-based inference, making language models accessible even on machines without GPUs.

 **2 - Text-to-Text Generation**

   - The [`text_to_text.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.inference.text_to_text) script manages the interaction with the language model, converting input text into a structured conversational podcast script.

   - It uses the `chat_completion` function to process the input text and a customizable system prompt, guiding the language to generate a text output (e.g. a coherent podcast script between speakers).

   - The `return_json` parameter allows the output to be formatted as a JSON object style, which can make it easier to parse and integrate structured responses into applications.

   - Supports both single-pass outputs (`text_to_text`) and real-time streamed responses (`text_to_text_stream`), offering flexibility for different use cases.


## **Step 3: Audio Podcast Generation**

In this final step, the generated podcast transcript is brought to life as an audio file. Using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, each speaker in the script is assigned a unique voice, creating an engaging and professional-sounding podcast.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Components in this Step**

**1 - Text-to-Speech Audio Generation**

   - The [`text_to_speech.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.inference.text_to_speech) script converts text into audio using a specified TTS model and tokenizer.

   - A **speaker profile** defines the voice characteristics (e.g., tone, speed, clarity) for each speaker.

   - The function `text_to_speech` takes the input text (e.g podcast script) and speaker profile, generating a waveform (audio data) that represents the spoken version of the text.

**2 - Parsing and Combining Voices**

- The [`script_to_audio.py`](api.md/#document_to_podcast.podcast_maker.script_to_audio) script ensures each speaker‚Äôs dialogue is spoken in their unique voice.

- The function `parse_script_to_waveform` splits the dialogue script by speakers and uses `text_to_speech` to generate audio for each speaker, stitching them together into a full podcast.

- Once the podcast waveform is ready, the save_waveform_as_file function saves it as an audio file (e.g., MP3 or WAV), making it ready for distribution.


## **Bringing It All Together in `app.py`**

The `app.py` demo app is shows you how all the components of the Document-to-Podcast Blueprint can come together. It demonstrates how you can take the individual steps‚ÄîDocument Pre-Processing, Podcast Script Generation, and Audio Podcast Generation‚Äîand integrate them into a functional application. This is the heart of the Blueprint in action, showing how you can build an app using the provided tools and components.

This demo uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source Python framework for interactive apps.

### üß† **How `app.py` Applies Each Step**

**üìÑ Document Upload & Pre-Processing**

   - Users upload a file via the Streamlit interface (`st.file_uploader`), which supports `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`, `.html`, and `.md` formats.

   - The uploaded file is passed to the **File Loading** and **Text Cleaning** modules.

   - Raw text is extracted using `DATA_LOADERS`, and the cleaned version is displayed alongside it using `DATA_CLEANERS`, and displayed to the end user.

**‚öôÔ∏è Loading Models**

- The script uses `load_llama_cpp_model` from `model_loader.py` to load the LLM for generating the podcast script.

- Similarly, `load_parler_tts_model_and_tokenizer` is used to prepare the TTS model and tokenizer for audio generation.

- These models are cached using `@st.cache_resource` to ensure fast and efficient reuse during app interactions.

**üìù Podcast Script Generation**

 - The cleaned text and a system-defined podcast prompt are fed into the text_to_text_stream function.

 - The `PODCAST_PROMPT` can be edited by the end-user to enable them to tailor their script results for their needs.

 - The script is streamed back to the user in real-time, allowing them to see the generated conversation between speakers

**üéôÔ∏è Podcast Generation**

- For each speaker in the podcast script, audio is generated using the `text_to_speech` function with distinct speaker profiles

- The `SPEAKER_DESCRIPTION` enables the user to edit the podcast speakers voices to fit their needs.

- The generated audio is displayed with a player so users can listen directly in the app.
